A student was caught dealing cigarettes to his classmates. Confiscating them would be seen as a bit of a corrupt move, but it would gain you some money. 
However, leaving the student with the cigarettes might hurt the ratings as he will continue to sell them.
Are you going to confiscate the cigarettes?
