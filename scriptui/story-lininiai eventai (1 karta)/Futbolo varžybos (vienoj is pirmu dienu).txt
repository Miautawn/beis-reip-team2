The school ratings are actually quite complicated. They not only consist from the grades of your students in official tests and exams,
but also from how they perform in olympiads, various sports events and even people's general opinion about the school. This is why today's football match is so important.
Today's match decides which team finishes 10th in the league. Of course, even getting this far is quite prestigious, but just think of the glory of getting into the top 10!
Chances of winning today's match are quite slim, though. Our team faces one of the league's leaders. But I think I might just have the trick up my sleeve that will tip the scales in our favour...
Are you going to bribe the referees?

Accept: (ta pacia arba kita diena) rating+++ money- corruption+ (tekstas tame evente: "Well, it's hard to say if the bribe was actually useful, 
but our boys won a hard-fought battle 3-2 and as such our team finished 10th in the league! Some fans were saying that the penalty was uncalled for, but I think we are in the clear now.")

Decline: (ta pacia arba kita diena) rating+ corruption- (tekstas tame evente: "After a hard-fought battle our boys came away with a tie 2-2. 
It's a little sad that our team came 11th because of the draw and although the bribe might have helped I just don't care - cheating has no place in football!")
