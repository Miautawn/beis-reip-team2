Mr. Evans has had problems with alcohol for a few years now. He was a good teacher and although he sometimes came to school while he wasn't fully sober, you always wrote it off as just a small wrongdoing.

He came to the school very drunk and for some reason tried to teach students anyway - it's not hard to imagine how that went.
Are you going to fire him?
