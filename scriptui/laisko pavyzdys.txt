Mr. Anderson          (cia vardas turi buti playerio)
Headmaster of
Gamer High School     (galima pakeist, idk)


Dear Mr. Anderson,    (player name)


You have been working as a Headmaster for this school for 15 years. However, we are afraid it is time to take matters into our own hands.
The school, which was once famous for its quality of education compared to other schools, is now at the bottom of the school ratings.
We feel as though it is time for a change in the school's administration - that also includes You, Mr. Anderson. We have found a candidate        (player name)
for the Headmaster's place. Nevertheless, we are giving you one last chance. If You manage to do the impossible - which is to climb up the 
school ratings back where the school belongs in 14 days (the ultimate goal being 1st place in the ratings) - you will keep your job.

You have 2 weeks, Mr. Anderson.    (player name)
Do not let us down.

Sincerely,
The Board of Gamer High School
